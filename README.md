Meteor.js Todo Application
==========================

[MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) stands out among the recent big Javascript
frameworks with its radical view on creating web applications. It seamlessly
connects the client side code with a [Node](http://nodejs.org/) +
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) based backend and promises unbelievably
fast application development.

As an introduction to Meteor.js, I set out to build a simple but properly
tested web application and share what I learned. This is the demo project
that follows the blog post on 
[getting started with  Meteor.js](https://semaphoreapp.com/blog/2014/11/19/meteorjs-getting-started.html).
